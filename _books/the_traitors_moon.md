# The Traitor's Moon

> These words are dangerous. Think carefully before you continue.

Agatha shouldn't be reading the books in the wizard's library, and she isn't even allowed to speak to the annoying rich boy, Haskell. The real apprentice. The one the wizard actually teaches. But they've uncovered a secret that's old and deadly. If they can't learn to work together, not even magic will save them.

Set in an alternate early industrial Britain, The Traitor's Moon explores themes of social justice whilst gently stretching the laws of thermodynamics. It was longlisted for the [Bath Children's Novel Award](https://bathnovelaward.co.uk/childrens-novel-award/) and [WriteMentor](https://write-mentor.com/) Children's Novel Award, and won a [Scottish Book Trust New Writers Award](https://www.scottishbooktrust.com/writing-and-authors/new-writers-awards/this-years-new-writers).
