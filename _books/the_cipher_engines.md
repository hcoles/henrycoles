# The Cipher Engines

The Cipher Engines is a story of cryptography and crows, set in Victorian England.

Early in the morning in 1862, a talking crow visits thirteen-year-old Ada Halting and tells her that there is no such thing as magic. She'll need his help as she's drawn into a world of secrets, codes and calculating engines. But what is the crow? And why must she tell him a story?

The Cipher Engines was [shortlisted for the Times/ChickenHouse IET150 prize](https://www.chickenhousebooks.com/blog/its-shortlist-time/) and the [Wells Book for Children Competition](https://www.wellsfestivalofliterature.org.uk/), and longlisted for the [WriteMentor](https://write-mentor.com/) Children's Novel award.
