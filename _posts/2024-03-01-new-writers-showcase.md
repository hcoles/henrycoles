title: New Writers Award Showcase 2024
---

A little under a year ago I got a surprise phone call from the Scottish Book Trust to tell me I'd won a New Writers Award. 

Unlike other awards, it's not just a cash prize, but a tailored package of courses and training and a chance to meet other writers and industry professionals.

It's been a great experience, and the year-long program has flown by. It culminated last night with the award showcase at the Assembly Roxy in Edinburgh.

So I spent a rare 29th of February giving my [first ever public reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEQeoOXGGL4&t=5220s).
