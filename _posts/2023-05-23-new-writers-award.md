title: Scottish Book Trust New Writers Award! 
---

I'm thrilled to the point of using an exclaimation mark to announce that I'm one of the [2023 Scottish Book Trust New Writer Awardees](https://www.scottishbooktrust.com/writing-and-authors/new-writers-awards/henry-coles). I'm looking forward to meeting the other winners and finding out
about all the Book Trust can offer.

The writing sample on the Book Trust site is from my current work in progress, but I entered with the opening chapters of The Traitor's Moon. One of the judges for the Childrens and YA category was [Kiran Millwood Hargrave](https://www.kiranmillwoodhargrave.com/), and I'm told that she loved it. Which is particularly gratifying as Girl of Ink and Stars was a big influence on my first two books.
