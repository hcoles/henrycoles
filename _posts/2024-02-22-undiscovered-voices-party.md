title: Undiscovered Voices Launch Party
---

Last night I put on a jacket and shirt for the first time in a decade and caught a train to London for the Undiscovered Voices launch party.

It was a fabulous evening. I finally got to meet the other winners in person, along with agents, editors and other publishing professionals.

I had one or two conversations that really were quite exciting, and will hopefully generate some more news in the future.
