Hi, I'm Henry. I live in Edinburgh and write middle grade fiction.

I'm one of the [2023 Scottish Book Trust New Writer Awardees](https://www.scottishbooktrust.com/writing-and-authors/new-writers-awards/this-years-new-writers), currently looking for an agent. 

As well as the Book Trust award, I've been shortlisted and longlisted in other competitions including [The Times/Chickenhouse Prize](https://www.chickenhousebooks.com/blog/its-shortlist-time/), [The Bath Children's Novel Award](https://bathnovelaward.co.uk/childrens-novel-award/), [Wells Book For Children](https://www.wellsfestivalofliterature.org.uk) and [The WriteMentor Novel Award](https://write-mentor.com/awards/). Some of them more than once.
